### Dockerfile
This Dockerfile was used to build the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bpeters504/beersmith2/ "https://hub.docker.com/r/bpeters504/beersmith2/").

There is no need to build the docker image yourself, you can just get it from the dockerhub repo by running beersmith2.sh

### beersmith2.sh
This is the script you should use to start beersmith. The first time you run it, it will down load the docker image. From then on, it will run it locally. The image is 491.7 MB installed.
